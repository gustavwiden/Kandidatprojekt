The "Models" folder contains txt-files according to the SUND model format
for the two mPBPK-models devloped for HV and SLE respectively.

There is also a json-file for each model with the best parameter set found during optimization.

Lastly, there is the schematic overview of the mPBPK-model in svg-format.

There is currently two separate parameters for internalization rate in plasma (kintp) and skin (kints).
This was to simplify the sensitivity analysis of this parameter for simulations in skin, but of course
a common kint parameter can be presented in eg. a list of final parameters in the article.
